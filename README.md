# Expert-guided Mixed-Initiative Control Switcher (EMICS) in MATLAB

Implementation of fuzzy inference system created for EMICS (for more information regarding the concept and the principles that govern 
the research project a good start could be https://github.com/uob-erl/fuzzy_mi_controller) with MATLAB. Suggested for those who do not have 
access to FuzzyLite software, in which the  controller is originally implemented, should they want to evaluate the performance of the fuzzy system.
